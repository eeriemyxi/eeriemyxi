I am available for freelance opportunities. Contact me via my [e-mail](mailto:myxi@envs.net?subject=I'd%20Like%20to%20Talk%20to%20You%20About%20a%20Freelance%20Project) to talk. You can find my PGP key [here](https://github.com/sponsors/eeriemyxi).

I am also available for employment in India. However, I will also gladly take a
remote job from anywhere.
